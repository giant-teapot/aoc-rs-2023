# You are in the input folder

This folder is meant to contain the input files you got from the advent of code website.

* Save your problem input here.
* Name it `day<N>.txt` where `<N>` is the day's number.
* For instance `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`, etc.
* Naming is important. Missing or misspelled files will prevent the corresponding day's solution from building.
