It is implemented in Rust as a learning exercise. No claim is made on the
quality or efficiency of any of the implementations.

## Usage instructions

There is one binary per day/problem. The implementations can be found under
`src/bin`.

To run any day's solution, proceed as follows:

* Download and save your problem's input under `input/`.
* The input file MUST be named `input/day<N>.txt`, where `<N>` is the problem
number.
* Build and run the corresponding binary:

```sh
cargo run --bin day<N>
```
